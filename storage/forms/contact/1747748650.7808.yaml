  Dear Osmosis Crew,

  Carty here! I've heard great things about your festival and would appreciate the chance to work as part of your safer spaces team this year.

  I co-organize the de-escalation, trip-sitting, and dancefloor monitors for Zap, a three-night punk, experimental and dance music campout, mainly energized by heads from the DMV, with some Philly and NY folks as well. I train people on de-escalation, security protocols, when and how to administer narcan, etc. I might do dancefloor monitoring or trip-sitting at Sustain this year. I've worked awareness and handled crises for a handful of raves in DC & Bmore. 

  My Signal is +1 917 589 6627, please don't hesitate to reach out with any question or concern. Hope to hear from you soon ^_^

  Gratefully,
  Carty
