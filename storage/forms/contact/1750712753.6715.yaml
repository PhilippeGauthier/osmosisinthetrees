  Hi hi!

  I found out about Osmosis through one of your organizers, Ian, at Dripping a couple weekends ago! We went on a canoe ride together with Sol and a couple of other friends on the first night of the festival. Really curious to come check Osmosis out :)) I work production for a couple of festivals around New York including Sustain and Dripping. Usually I'll show up early in the week for both of these festivals to help get things in order before ~the show~ begins. Really enjoy doing this and being a part of the crew. Curious if y'all might still be looking for extra help on your production team?
