  Greetings!

  My name is Jam and a few of my buddies are headed to this festival this year. I am wondering if you guys have any positions open for work or volunteering. My production experience primarily consists of site ops/decor related things, but I also have pretty extensive experience in stage manager and head coordinator roles. 

  If you guys already have a solid team, then no worries, but I wanted to reach out because this looks like a wonderful festival to be involved in! I'd be happy to send over a resume. Let me know!

  Cheers,

  Jam Albert
