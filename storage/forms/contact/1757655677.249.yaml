  Hi! I purchased tickets for me and my friend, we are local to GP and are super excited to attend this event :)

  We have the weekend pass and I was curious if we were still allowed to set up/ camp Thursday night even though we do not have the event pass for Thursday. Just wanted to make sure we were following the rules and such, but also want to get there and set up as soon as we are allowed! Let me know, thanks

  Jonathan
