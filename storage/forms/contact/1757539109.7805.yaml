  Hi there! 

  My name is Michelle, and I’m a longtime rave journalist covering the global electronic music underground in my newsletter Rave New World, as well as outlets including VICE (where I ran the electronic music section for many years), Dazed, RA, GQ, and New York Magazine. 

  I have been hearing amazing things about Osmosis and a few of my friends are actually playing this year too. I wanted to open up a conversation about covering the event, doing interviews eight the founder, getting a press pass etc, and learn more about what you guys might be open to and interested in sharing. 

  Please get back in touch, I’m excited to connect! 

  Michelle
