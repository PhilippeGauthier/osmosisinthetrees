  Hello there, 
  If you have any remaining volunteer opportunities, I would love to lend a hand. I have volunteered for many local festivals over the years, most notably at Cascadian Midsummer on an annual basis up on the Olympic Peninsula. I don't mind manual labor or dirty jobs, and have worked professionally in both construction and event waste management. I've also driven in a professional capacity, so would be happy to help with load-in/out if desired. Overall, I am a quick study and love to learn new things, so otherwise am willing to aid in any way desired, with minimal instruction, in a reliable, efficient, and cheerful manner.
  I hope this message finds you well and look forward to hearing from you [:
  Sending serendipity,
  Emry
