  Hi all, 

  This looks like an amazing gathering and lineup. My partner and I would be very excited to get involved. By prefrence we would love to vend, but are open to other opportunities to help. We have an established booth set up (hand blown glass and wood engraved art mostly) but also love creating community space for people to connect. We don't have the finances to pay much (at least not up front), but again we'd be very happy to volunteer some time. We both have years of experience working festivals and events, and I'm confident that we'd be an asset at Osmosis this year.

  Thanks, 
  Kinda and Chewie
