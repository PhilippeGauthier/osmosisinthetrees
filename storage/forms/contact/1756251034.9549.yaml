Of course we have invited them to join us, because while it will be our first time in the trees, Osmosis def has the energy to flex to our int'l travelers. Anyways, they are very interested, but are hesitant with their meager budget for their travel. We are afraid if they do not come, that that may affect our plans as well... Sooo I wanted to see if y'all might be willing to offer them discount tickets of any sort to sweeten the deal. Cross the pond sound solidarity sorta thing. Absolutely no worries if not:) If you need their specific names for possible discount tickets, please let me know!"
