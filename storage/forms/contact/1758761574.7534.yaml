message_body: 'hello! i have a 2 day ticket for this weekend, but a recent and ongoing family emergency means i won’t be able to use it. i don’t have the capacity to be in a festival environment at this time and there is a chance i may need to fly home to help out. i know this is too last minute to ask for a refund, so i’m reaching out in hopes that you may know of someone i can resell my ticket to. i’m so bummed i won’t be able to make it this year, i was looking forward to seeing the fruits of all of your hard work and to dancing to some incredible artists! thank you for your help with this :)'
