  Hi Osmosis Team!

  I’m a grad student at UC Berkeley and my research and work focus on improving healthcare access for trans communities. I’d really love to come to  Osmosis this year, and I’m wondering if you all offer any kind of discounts on tickets.

  Money’s always tight in grad school, and a discount would make it possible to be there and be part of the experience.

  Thanks so much for your time, and I appreciate any info you can share!

  Much love,
  Kae
