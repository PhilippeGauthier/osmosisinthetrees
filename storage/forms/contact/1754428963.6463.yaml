  (HI NIC! TY again for coming to my block party!! 🫶🏼)

  Reaching out about potential volunteer opportunities/trade for a discounted ticket. I throw experiential events in San Francisco and am not exactly flush on cash (ha!), plus I would be absolutely thrilled to be more deeply involved in osmosis.

  I can't arrive until Friday due to my work schedule, but I could stay a day or two late to support with load-out if that's helpful. I have heaps of bartending experience too.

  Let me know if there are any opportunities for me to help during or after the weekend! Hoping we can work something out <3
