  Hellllo! 

  Im super interested in Osmosis-- times are tough and a nature boogie with loving community sounds like the perfect medicine.

  I was laid-off from my fulltime job in DEI in July and have been slowly building my own somatic practice. I would very much welcome consideration for reduced ticket cost. 

  Im BIPOC-kin, single and have a mortgage... would likely be coming solo. Im happy to provide transportation if people or things are in need to transport.  

  Thanks for considering
