  Hello you guys!! 
  Some of you may have been at the gate when I popped by. For those who werenâ€™t, Iâ€™m the Nextdoor neighbor with the severed arms on the gate and the pirate costume. I left a few of my cards in case you ever need a hand with ADA services or extra radiosðŸ˜‚. My partner and i have worked in the local events, myself in ada logistics and Blake with production (Apple jam Music Festival), community for the last 15 years and were so pleasantly surprised to have you light up the weekend. I have many friends who attended prior to your move south and we hope to join you next year for a dance. Welcome to the neighborhood.
