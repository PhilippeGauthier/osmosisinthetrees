  Hello!

  I know it’s a little late in the game to reach out about volunteering and/or contributing—hopefully, better late than never. I’m interested in contributing and/or volunteering because I enjoy helping to provide experiences for our community to enjoy dance music and connect, and because the cost is currently a barrier for me to attend.

  I volunteered at Portal Boogie a couple of weeks ago (parking & ambient stage setup) and have years of paid and volunteer festival work experience. I’m open to jumping in and helping wherever I’m needed. I can come early or stay late for build/strike if necessary, but something Thursday-Sunday would be ideal.

  First off, I wanted to offer to provide/build some comfortable, sturdy wooden benches (with backs), ideally to give hard-working ravers comfortable places to sit and take a load off at the back of the dancefloor. I enjoyed building and providing two of these benches for Portal Boogie and have the supplies to build at least two more. I’m open to thoughts, suggestions, etc.

  Benches or not, I thought I should share about my relevant experience. I have 10 years of Event Production, Festival Build, Audio, Lighting, and Stage Management experience. I’m not afraid to get my hands dirty during build/strike and have technical skills from years of AV work. More details are below–sorry if it comes off as a bit of a resume.

  Freelance AV Technician (2016–present):
  I’ve worked as a Freelance Audio-Visual Technician since 2016, mostly in the SF Bay Area. Many of my recent projects were with Know::Audio for clients such as Robot Heart, Monarch SF, and Bar Part Time.

  Events Lead for Inquiry Collective, LLC (2016–2021):
  I co-founded Inquiry Collective in 2016 and led its events business until 2021. I managed both build and stage management for Inquiry’s small annual desert festival, Curiosity, which featured 36+ hours of non-stop music. In 2018, we expanded into club events and undergrounds in SF and LA, for which I handled everything from booking artists to working the door, stage managing, and much more.

  Camp Lead for sixes&sevens Burning Man Camp (2019–2024):
  I started and ran a 20–30 person Burning Man sound camp, sixes&sevens, from 2019–2024 (we were at 9:30 & C in 2023). Most years, I was in charge of build, strike, finances, and power distribution (among other responsibilities). We had quite the sound system for a camp of our size, featuring two Danley SM97s and eight Labhorns. :)

  Paid Festival Work Experience:
  - Audio (Strike Only) with Chino Sound @ LiB 2024
  - RV Parking & Group Camp Placement @ LiB 2024

  Festival Volunteer Experience:
  - Ambient Stage Setup & Parking @ Portal Boogie 2025
  - Audio (Build & Strike) with Chino Sound @ The Untz 2023
  - Build + Stage Manager @ Umbrella Weekend 2023
  - Parking @ Desert Hearts 2017
  - Build @ LiB 2016–2017
  - Build @ Dirtybird Campout 2016–2017
  - Stage Hand @ Symbiosis 2015

  Lastly, worth noting that I'm based in Portland and have enjoyed attending quite a few of the Osmosis events at Ming Lounge and Process.

  Thanks!
  Sam
