  Hi there!

  I was wondering if osmosis in the trees is looking for any more volunteers.

  I work as an assistant director as my full time job and am experienced when it comes to coordinating & helping execute plans.
  I am also familiar with setting up sound systems, setting up / breaking down gear etc.

  I’m also fully trained in walkie etiquette!
  Cheers ❤️
