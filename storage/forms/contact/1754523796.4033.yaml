  Hi! We are curious about any volunteer opportunities available? We came for the first time last year as friends of a visual artist, Loaf Baker. Aside from that connection we live in Bend and don't have a lot of overlap in the Portland community, so volunteering seems like a great way to meet people.

  For special skills, I'm a programmer and capable fabricator who has worked on many art installations over a couple decades raving and 10 burns. I've also been involved in different aspects of production and thrown my own parties and festivals. My partner is a little more green to the scene but very down and outgoing. We're both just happy to get involved with anything ya need!

  Thanks!
