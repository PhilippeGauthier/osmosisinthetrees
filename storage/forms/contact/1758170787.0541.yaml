  Hi! For Thursday programming but in particular the dinner special, is that at a set time? I can't find any info about it now. Thanks! I wanna buy a Thursday ticket (and convince friend) but not sure if she can escape work early enough if it's a set time sort of deal. Lmk? Thanks! 

  Also if I secured a three day ticket right now, is there any transfer ability to a two day if that makes more sense for us?
