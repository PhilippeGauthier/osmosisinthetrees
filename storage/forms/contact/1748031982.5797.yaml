  [Volunteer Photographer Inquiry]

  Hi friends!!

  Big fan of your programming and have wanted to make it out to the festival for a while. The Slowfoam and enereph recordings are sooooo gorgeous.

  I'm wondering if y'all might want a photographer to capture some images for marketing/press/documentation. The festival looks super beautiful from what I see in people's stories but I don't see too much actual photography from past editions so thought I'd ask.

  I'd do it for free, just hoping for comped admission (:

  I can't attach images here but here's my portfolio with some images from Sustain-Release (official) in NYC as well as Dripping, Dekmantel, etc. (less official). I shoot exclusively with compact film cameras so I like to think I'm pretty discrete and don't disrupt the vibe at all. Nobody likes a big camera in their face when they're trying to get lost in the music!
