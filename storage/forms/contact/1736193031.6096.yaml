  Dear Osmosis ,

  I trust this message finds you well. We are Holotropic and Sasemoi from The Netherlands, together we perform an electronic live performance. We admire the atmosphere and programming your event wishes to bring and think we hold ourselves to the same values and standards. We are confident that our music would be a valuable addition to the experience Osmosis wishes to create.

  Our sound can be described as a constant groove of dreamy yet driving electronic music, taking influences from downtempo, dub, minimal, techno and house, and shaped by experiences at events much like your own.

  If this is something you are interested in, we'd like to share with you a short video and recording of our set at Landjuweel festival in Amsterdam:

  Should you require any additional information or have specific criteria for submissions, please do not hesitate to let us know. We appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to the possibility of creating lasting moments together.

  Thank you for your attention, we eagerly await your response.


  All the best,
