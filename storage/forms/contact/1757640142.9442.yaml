  Hi! 

  My name is Amanda and I am very excited to attend Osmosis. I am disabled and rely on a walker or forearm crutches to get around. I am able to handle a limited amount of stairs. I wanted to reach out to see if some accommodations were possible for the event. 

  1) Is it possible for me to have access to an accessible bathroom? 

  2) I will be attending with two other people and we plan to camp with one car and one tent. Is it possible to reserve a spot within the camping or parking area that is closer to the main site and restrooms? Walking can cause me pain and fatigue and I would like to save my legs for the dance floor :) 

  3) Could I get a copy of the site map and estimated size in advance? This helps me plan what mobility aids I will bring. I do have an off-road electric wheelchair that I may bring if things are particularly spread out. 

  Thank you so much for your attention to this and putting on Osmosis! Can't wait :)

  Best,
  Amanda
