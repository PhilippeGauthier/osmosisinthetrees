  hi there! really looking forward to osmosis this year! quick question - i recently attended meadow (outdoor fest in washington) and they offered discounted tickets for medical professionals who agreed to take a shift. i am wondering this fest does or would consider a similar option? i’ve already purchased an early bird thurs-sun ticket… 

  thanks for everything and see ya there!
