  Hi!

  I am interested in indulging in the beautiful experience that is Osmosis in the Trees this year, some of my friends have performed and played in the past and have nothing but positive things to say. 
  I am wondering if you are open to and/or accepting work trade for this year's fest? Money is tight and am hoping y'all might need an extra pair of hands :)

  Thank you so much and have a lovely day, 

  Rose LoDolce
