  Hello there! I’d love to assist with this event wherever there might be a need! I’m volunteering to do trash maintenance at the upcoming Portal Boogie and some friends suggested I reach out to see if there are any more opportunities for Osmosis in the Trees ✨✨ I’d be happy to assist with things such as harm reduction, trash, build, creating a space, gate/check in, etc! 
  I’ve attended several Osmosis events and truly love the energy and environment your group cultivates. I look forward to connecting soon and helping if there’s space for me somewhere. Thanks so much!
