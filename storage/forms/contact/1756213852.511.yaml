  Hello there! I’m reaching out to see if y’all still need volunteers for this year. My friend Vicktoria is helping out and suggested I get in touch. More than happy to do whatever, though I do have some decent experience with live production of sound and a little visual. I don’t know exactly how much time I have to set up before the event but would be happy to work the actual event in some capacity and maybe with tear down or something too. 

  Looking forward to it!
  Best,
  Nathanael
