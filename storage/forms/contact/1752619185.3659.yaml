  Hey! 
  I was thinking about driving out from SLC for this. The lineup is pretty sick and the smaller festivals in the US are getting better and better.  Is it possible to camp in a van there? I saw there is a parking area and a camping area. It is self contained meaning I don't need hookups and the grey water stays in the vehicle.
