  Hi there,

  I've heard so much about the beautiful programming at Osmosis and would love to attend this year's upcoming iteration. However, given the combined price of rental car, tolls, gas, camping equipment and the ticket itself, I'm having trouble budgeting enough to make this a possibility. I was wondering if it were still possible to purchase a discounted ticket - thank you so so much!

  Best,
  Marc
