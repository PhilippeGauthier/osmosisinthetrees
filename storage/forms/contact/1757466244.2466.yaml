  Hi Osmosis crew,

  Providing a follow up on Issak, since he recently attended a music event in Seattle using a different name (to disguise his identity). Passing along the names he may use/has used to purchase a ticket to Osmosis.

  Isaak Yansane 
  Isaak Yansane-Sisk
  Isaak Dillon Sisk 
  Isaak Dillon Yansane-Sisk

  He has also uses his middle name to purchase things. It’s spelled either Skyler or Schuyler. Could be used in combination with the other names listed above.

  Also I help organize a DIY arts and music event called Big Moon, held in a remote part of Leavenworth, WA. This year’s gathering took place from August 15–17, marking it our fourth year hosting the event. We’re a team of six organizers and two medic nurses, and this year we welcomed around 180 attendees. Unfortunately we had a very challenging and violent drug-related crisis at Big Moon. One attendee engaged in self-harm, physically assaulted four people, and caused property damage (including smashing a car window). The incident took place for about 3 hours and the individual resisted help from organizers and nurses. I’m not certain whether this individual and their partner plan to attend Osmosis, but one of them is a well-known DJ in Seattle. I can share their information if that would be helpful.

  As a fellow organizer, I wanted to share some reflections from the aftermath of that situation and propose some considerations for your team:

  	•	Beyond basic harm reduction, what additional steps can we take? Physical, mental, and behavioral health need to be central when addressing drug use.

  	•	How do we remind attendees that being in these spaces is a privilege—not an opportunity for reckless experimentation or drug binges?

  	•	What is the clear de-escalation plan? Who is designated for this role, and how will attendees identify them?

  	•	If someone violates community agreements at an event, how is that handled? What is the protocol for safely escorting someone off-site if needed? In our situation, several community agreements were violated, and as a result, the individual and their partner were asked to remain away from the event/ dance hall for the rest of the gathering. They were relocated to a nearby cabin for the remainder of the party.

  	•	Are all organizers trained in CPR and Narcan administration?

  	•	Is there a defibrillator on-site?

  	•	What are the criteria for calling EMS, and is the nearest hospital accessible?

  	•	Is physical restraint ever an option? (This carries serious liability and should be discussed in advance.)

  	•	Is there a designated safe/sheltered space away from the main event for de-escalation?

  	•	Are calming agents (“downers”) accessible and considered acceptable?

  	•	Can a trusted friend or familiar face be identified to intervene? (In our experience, a person in crisis often responds better to someone they know than to a stranger or staff.)

  I recognize these are difficult questions, but they are ones we were forced to confront at Big Moon. Feel to reach out to me if you have any questions/comments. I appreciate all the work you and your team put into making these events both safe and memorable. 

  Thanks,
  Soraya
