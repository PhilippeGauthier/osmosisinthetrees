  Hi! 
  We were planning on buying tickets for the two of us after my partner got her latest paycheck, but she just had to leave her job because of her disabilities, so we are both out of work due to health stuff, and money's pretty tight rn. Sorry to be contacting you all so late about this, but if there's any way to still get discounted tickets, that would be very helpful. Totally understand if we missed the boat on that though - I know we are contacting you kinda late. We appreciate yall regardless!
  <3 Nikki & Spritzy
