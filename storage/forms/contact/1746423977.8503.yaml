  Osmosis,

  I reached out a few months back, inquiring about volunteering opportunities for this year's edition! I've kept my eye out for volunteer forms and haven't been able to find anything - I may be totally looking in the wrong place! 

  I am a student at the University of Oregon and would like to pursue my passion for electronic music post-grad, whether that be in the event industry, label management, production, or all combined! I think volunteering at an event like Osmosis could provide me with some solid foundational knowledge of the event side of the scene. I even wrote a little letter of interest that I would be thrilled to send to you guys, if you are open to it. Thank you!
