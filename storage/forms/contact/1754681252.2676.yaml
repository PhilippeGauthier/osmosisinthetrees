  Hi Osmosis! 
  Looking for a volunteer shift to offset the cost of tier 3 tickets.  We had planned to be out of State, but unfortunately things fell through and now we’d love to be with our chosen family.  Looking for one volunteer slot for myself. I can do all the things, from crowd management, to infrastructure to cooking.  I’m a professional organizer and builder of all things.
