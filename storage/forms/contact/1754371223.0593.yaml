  I’m interested in volunteering!!

  Hi if you still need volunteers I’m going to be arriving as soon as early as possible from Seattle on Thursday and leaving Sunday.

  I have experience setting up dancefloor decorations for parties up here and am also happy to haul stuff around or help with whatever! 
  My preference for timing would be early ish so i can lock in for the rest of the fest and leave when my carpool needs to on Sunday… 

  I can’t wait, thanks!!!!
