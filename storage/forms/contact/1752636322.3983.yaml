  Hey there, I went to this a couple years ago and had a *beautiful* time! 
  I was just reminded about it and am hopeful I can come.
  My situation is tricky in that I am very low income AND, more important; I am waiting to get scheduled for major surgery and won’t likely know when my date is in time for early pricing (like if fest is after surgery i can’t go and wouldn’t buy a ticket but if fest is before surgery i would want to get cheapest possible rate). 
  Soooo basically I am writing to ask if I may be able to “hold” the early rate until I learn when my surgery is? Even tho I may not know until last minute…
  And if so, how would that work?
  Thanks for your consideration!
