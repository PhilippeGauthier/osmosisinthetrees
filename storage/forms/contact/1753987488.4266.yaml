  Hi there, I emailed a little while ago about volunteering opportunities at the festival but didn't hear anything back so I thought I would check in. Would love to volunteer in any capacity necessary! I have experience working gates / bars / bag check at glastonbury. Currently work full time in film + have experience set building etc in case you need help with set up. Let me know! I know my friend zoe is already on the volunteer list and we were really hoping to join together. Also, sorry if I sent this meassage a million times, the 'send message' button was acting crazy on my phone. 

  Thank you for your time !
