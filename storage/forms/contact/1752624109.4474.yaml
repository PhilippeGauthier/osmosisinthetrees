  Hi,
  I'm reaching out for discounted tickets and was wondering if it would be possible for me to get two of them and how much it would cost if so. Also, for camping at the event, is it okay to sleep in a car? I don't own a tent or any camping gear and was worried that would hinder me from attending as well.
  Thank you!!!
