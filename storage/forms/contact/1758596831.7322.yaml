  Hi there!!!

   I have been meaning to reach out. I am the closest (adjacent on 3 of my 4  fence lines) neighbor to the venue. Last year I met those working the gate briefly to mitigate confusion if our Halloween guests got caught up in your traffic. We were also super bummed to be double booked and unable to attend.

  This year, we definitely have been hoping to come check out all the magic! Unfortunately, we’ve been dealing with some financial strain. I wondered if there would be possibility to work out a pair of discounted tickets for my husband and I so that we aren’t solo raging in our yard and may come join the fun!!
