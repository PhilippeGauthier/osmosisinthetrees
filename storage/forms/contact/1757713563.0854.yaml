  Hello,

  I’m Zea, editor at NASTY Magazine. Hope you’ve seen some of our recent digital covers with Adiel, Emilija, Sara Landry, Deborah de Luca, Enrico San Giuliano — just wanted to reach out and see if we could do something cool together for one your upcoming events.

  We’d love to support you with a proper campaign on our website and social channels. We’ve worked so far with:  Boiler Room, Amnesia/Pyramid, Sphere Las Vegas, Berlin Atonal, Tresor, Ostgut Ton, Afterlife, Neopop, Sonar, Stone Festival, Basilar, Awakenings Upclose, Whole Festival - always finding a way to make the story visually strong and aligned with the artist’s world. More on our music section: https://www.nastymagazine.com/music/

  If it sounds interesting, I’d be happy to share a proposal with rates and what’s included. Could be a great way to connect with our audience and give your lineup some extra love (we currently have a monthly view reach or almost 3 million).

  Here’s our music media kit if you want to have a look: https://bit.ly/NastyMusic-Mediakit

  Let me know what you think!

  Best,
  Zea
  Editor, NASTY Magazine
