  Hello,

  Iâ€™m reaching out regarding my two-day pass (Friday and Saturday), order number RA45863483-078. I purchased the ticket on 9/23, but unfortunately, due to an unexpected hospitalization of my parent on 9/24, I will no longer be able to attend.

  I wanted to reach out to see if it was still possible to receive a refund under these circumstances. It would be extremely helpful, and I greatly appreciate your understanding.

  Thank you for your time and consideration.

  Best,
  Alexia Lobato
