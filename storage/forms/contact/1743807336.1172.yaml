message_body: "Hello Osmosis Team -- I just purchased early-bird tickets for this year's event, and couldn't be more excited! I see that treehouses are listed on your site as being 'SOLD OUT' but I was able to book the Peacock Perch (through treehouses.com) and it seems like others are still listed as available. I'm writing mostly to verify that my booking is legit and my treehouse will be within proximity to the party...? Appreciate your assistance. Can't wait to dance in the trees with you.
