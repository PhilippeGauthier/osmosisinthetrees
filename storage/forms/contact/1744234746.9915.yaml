  Osmosis, I sent this email a few months ago:

  Heyo! I know you guys haven't yet updated the page from last year's event, but I just wanted to throw my name in the loop for volunteers. I am a student at the University of Oregon and would like to pursue my passion for electronic music post-grad, whether that be in the event industry, label management, production, or all combined! I think volunteering at an event like Osmosis could provide me with some solid foundational knowledge of the event side of the scene. Would love to hear more about this opportunity if you are taking on volunteers for this years festivities. Thank you!

  I just wanted to circle back and see if a form has opened up, as I would be more than interested to apply. Cheers!
