  Hey Osmosis crew,
  I’d really love to come down from Seattle, but I’m a full time student / unpaid therapy intern for now and can’t swing the full ticket price this summer. Would it be possible to access a discounted ticket? Also if you’re looking for any setup / tear down help I’d be delighted to lend some hours. 

  Thank youuu!

  Taylor
