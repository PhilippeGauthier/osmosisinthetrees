  Hi!

  I saw all the amazing videos and photos of last year's Osmosis, and I'd love to participate this year. I'm a huge fan of all the amazing programming and thoughtful curation that the festival prioritizes for a lovely experience!

  After factoring in car, tolls, and gas as well as ticket cost, I realized that it may be out of budget for me to attend the festival this year. I was wondering if there were still discounted tickets available? Thank you so much for your consideration!

  Best,
  Marc
