  Good afternoon Osmosis:)

  I have been wanting to go to Osmosis for a couple years now but usually am busy wildland firefighting at this point in the year. This january I broke my back and was unable to go wildland firefighting this summer which is my source of income. I have been living off my savings to allow my back time to heal properly. I have managed to aquire a ride down to Osmosis with my friends who are running the bar, but I am reaching out for a discounted ticket. I have never done anything like this before and truly love to support grassroot events, but am not financially able to at this current point in my life.I know it’s probably too late to reach out about this and you’re all probably busy doing more important tasks right about now. I really am grateful for what yall are bringing to the west coast and hope to support more in the coming years. Thanks for everything!
