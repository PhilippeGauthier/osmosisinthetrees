  Hi there! I have helped organize a small open air in Texas called Midnight In Nowhere and have experience with helping run electronic art and music experiences. I have a professional DJ setup (xone 96, 2x technics sl1200, and some CDJs.

   I also have a full sized PA system if you’d like to partner for another stage next year! (6x18” subwoofers) four mid/tops. 

  My insta is @quang.oi_ and the project I co-run is called @terminal.tx
