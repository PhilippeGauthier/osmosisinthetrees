  Hi! This is Zane (Zeynep Oner) from Seattle. I have been to some of your shows and would love to volunteer for the fest. I'm trained and have volunteered for first aid for rave injuries: cuts, scrapes, burns, twisted ankles and knees, bruises, swollen hands (when you fan too hard for too long), over heating, floored blood sugar etc. I call them ouchies and boo boos, but joking aside I'm very experienced with all kinds of rave injuries and, as I said before, I'm also trained. I can also do all kinds of odd jobs whenever needed. I've done checking people in to cleaning up the venue after the festival is done and the crew is busy packing gear, and everything in between. My ig is @mszynponr. I can be referenced by all Seattle crews: research, shameless, between the lines, data club, makes me human... And by venues: Forest Creek Events' Chris Anderson and Diffusion's Zeebo..

  Thank you for reading and considering me as a volunteer.

  Zane
