        text: 'Respect for the site is essential and we need all attendees to help us maintain the natural beauty of the grounds - this means no glitter, confetti, etc. Leave no trace - ample trash, recycling, and compost cans will be provided. Fully clean your treehouse or campsite when you go. Do not leave any trash on the ground, period. Cigarette butts must be fully extinguished and properly disposed of. Please do not throw butts in the fire pit. This is our first time working with the venue, let’s do this right so we can keep coming back.'

        text: 'Smoking is allowed in the tree village area. There is absolutely no smoking in the fields or woods surrounding it, including the stages. This is no joke. The surrounding area is extremely prone to wildfires and you don’t want to be the jerk who causes one. We will very actively enforce this policy and reserve the right to immediately eject anyone who does not comply. Finally, please do not smoke in the treehouses. It is against property policy.'
