        text: "Carré is a producer, DJ, label head, and co-founder of Fast At Work, the future-minded underground party series and newly minted label, based in Los Angeles. Following an electric debut with her two-track EP 'Tilted/Fainting', which was released on Darwin's Berlin-based label SPE:C and named by Mixmag as one of the Best EPs of 2023, Carré is starting 2024 with a new record and an exciting announcement. 'Soft Fascination’ is a three-sided exploration of modern low-end tendencies and broken beat percussion, that marks the launch of Fast At Work's own imprint. Carré is one of the forces behind Fast At Work, touted as \"one of LA's best warehouse parties\" by Resident Advisor, and also where she became established as a DJ known for her subversive sets focusing on dubstep, leftfield techno and low-end heavy sounds. Recently making her Berlin, Paris, and London debut Carré has played in support of artists like Special Request, Objekt, Darwin, TSVI, Roza Terenzi, DJ Python and more."
