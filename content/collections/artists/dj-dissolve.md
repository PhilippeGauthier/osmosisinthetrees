        text: "dj dissolve is 4th generation Portlander, Producer, DJ, and co-founder of the artist collective SoulHouse. Inspired by the hypnotic and connective power of electronic music, he uses dance, DJing and production as tools for community healing and social activism. While he is a big proponent of supporting the local scene, his taste for the underground was heavily shaped by a 2019 academic semester spent abroad studying in Frankfurt, Germany, where he was finally able to grasp the global influence of Chicago house and Detroit techno. He is inspired by music’s power to heal and connect, and he draws inspiration from the diverse sounds, dances, and spirits that have been emitted from the Willamette Valley for millennia. He views his time on earth as a continuation of this ancient tradition and through every set he seeks to honor the selectors, dancers, and spirit guides who have come before him. Whether he's behind the mixing board, putting on a record, or cueing up with CDJs, dj dissolve’s singular goal remains unchanged: to make his call to the dance floor---irresistible."
