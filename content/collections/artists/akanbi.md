        text: "Akanbi is a fountain of energy whose passion and enthusiasm for music & humanity is undiluted and unmatched. As a DJ he possesses an amazing level of restraint that balances his ball-of-fire spirit. He brings a focused intention to the community as an organizer, tapping into the spiritual frequencies that go beyond the surface. In 2014, he started New York City's GROOVY GROOVY party - a judgment-free atmosphere for wild dance floors, spiritual, mental & physical rejuvenation, radical politics, and a dose of undeniably rocking talent. Akanbi has made an impression with visionary sets across the globe."
