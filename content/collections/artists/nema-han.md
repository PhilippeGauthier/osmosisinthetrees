Nema expanded\_their passion for electronic music and sound design in Berlin before returning to New York where they've been cutting their teeth refining the art of finding and blending records. As a DJ, Nema transcends genres and boundaries, exhibiting their approach to life and their creative processes through their psychedelic and emotionally expansive selections that are both timeless and playfully curious. They are also part of a collaborative project: DJ SYNCLAIRE, a duo of dedicated diggers known for their fierce synergy of genre melting quest, charged with atemporal gems."
