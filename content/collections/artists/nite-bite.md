        text: 'nite bite is the moniker of Emma Scruggs, an avid midnight snacker and vibesmith who is dedicated to creating spaces for connections to organically unfold. She exudes focused yet playful creativity in her sets inspired by the magnetic bonds she forges with the community around her. Having grown up in Japan and spending most of her life on the West Coast, she is a master of all things chill but also knows how to turn up with left-field techno and heavy bass infused with an archive of 90â€™s rave tunes that spice up her sets and leave you in introspective bliss.'
