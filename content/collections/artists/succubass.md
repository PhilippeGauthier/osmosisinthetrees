        text: 'All West Coast ravers worth their salt are intimately familiar with the expansive stylings of Seattleâ€™s Succubass. Her technical prowess and fierce style have earned her high praise from her appearances at revered institutions like Sustain-Release, REEF, Nowadays, Basement, and Honcho. A busy touring schedule and a string of residencies currently keep Succubass rightfully occupied as she spreads her devious gospel across the country, cracking skulls and shaking asses wherever the dance floor she graces.'
