        text: 'With a deep reverence for dance music and its history, Rob uses tracks spanning decades, of all flavours, to establish a heavy groove on any dancefloor he hosts. Expect a solid base of swinging four to the floor with plenty of room for broken bits. His ability to tune into the ever-shifting mood of the environment around him allows him to establish give and take with his audience. He receives, transforms, and directs back the energy that the floor brings, a process he deems crucial to any great party.'

        text: "Previously a dancer without a living scene, arriving in PDX was a revelation to him. Since he landed in 2020, he's been dedicated to expanding and strengthening the PDX and broader PNW dance scenes in whatever ways he can. This is often through volunteer work or organizing parties with GroupSound. He often prefers to blend in, keeping the focus on the music that changed his life."
