        text: "In the fall of 1992, Silpher discovered the Oregon rave scene.\_ It was love at first sight, reorienting his focus directly on everything related to Electronic Dance Music, starting with helping to found the University of Oregon's campus radio station (KWVA), as the Electronic Music Director.\_ Since then, in addition to consistently introducing his listeners to the outlying frontiers of Electronic Dance Music, Silpher has promoted events, owned and operated a ServoDrive / Sound Physics Labs sound system (Stylus Systems), owned and managed a record store (Stylus Grooves), designed party flyers, and is always down to teach anyone how to spin records."
