        text: 'DJ Temporaryâ€™s sound is rustling, fresh, and distinctly alive. With strong roots in dub, psy, and early prog, his sets swell effortlessly between vaporous, tendril-like grooves and moments of raw, psychedelic power. Notably one of the residents of the Groovy Groovy party NYC, you may have caught one of his closing sunrise sets at several Brooklyn DIYs, or in the forests of the greater tri-state area at festivals such as Dripping or Sustain-Release.'
