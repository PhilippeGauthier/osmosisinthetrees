        text: 'aka-Sol is an Ecuadorian DJ, producer and multidisciplinary artist based in Queens, NY. Through their Acacia Baila label, and “Dripping” event series they’re also a connector, releasing music and mixes from a broad global community of collaborators and close friends as well as curating ecstatic events drawing lines between experimental performances and club music. As a DJ, their sets are genre-defying and psychedelic, with a big focus on storytelling and charged with amped doses of expansiveness and nostalgia; capturing with it the essence of a “true-raver”.'
