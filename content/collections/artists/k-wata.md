        text: 'K Wata is an NYC-based artist, DJ, and co-founder of the SLINK label and club night. His sound has been described by Boomkat as “bassbin minimalism”, consisting of spacious dub textures and skeletal club rhythms. As a DJ, he has built a reputation for dynamic sets held together by precise experimentation and genre-agnostic blends.'
