        text: 'Founder of the label Isla and an integral part of projects such as Ambien Baby, Dosis, La Fe, SINNAZ, Sin Limites, and OSS, the Colombian-born artist inhabits a ‘wild card’ space within his deejaying and productions where everything goes, and nothing is off limits. Open to any sort of playing situation (from the rave to the chill-out and in between), and you can always expect an empathetic and hybrid set of grooves from a free-willin’ selector.'
