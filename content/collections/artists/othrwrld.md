        text: "othrwrld is a trans woman producer, DJ, and self proclaimed aural apothecary, using sound and atmosphere to open portals into new utopian possibilities for trans posthuman club creatures to experience collective immanence and healing.\_ Equally likely to find her sweating behind the decks at a late night warehouse rave enshrouded in fog, or sitting peacefully weaving textures in a dimly lit chillroom, othrwrld sits on the cutting edge of trans futuristic music from hypnotic psytechno, bass, and ritualistic rhythms to slambient mind journeys, soundbaths and deep dubbed out dancefloors."
