        text: "Born in Egypt and now residing in the Pacific Northwest, Moussa is a Portland-based artist who has been pushing the boundaries of sound for nearly a decade. Moussa is known for his deep exploration of the underground realms of house and techno, weaving together diverse influences to create immersive and experimental sets. His approach to music is rooted in art and discovery, always seeking to take dancers on a journey through uncharted sonic landscapes. Moussa's sets are a testament to his passion for the deeper side of electronic music. Following the thread without boundaries, he invites listeners and dancers to connect with the rhythm and flow of the dance floor’s vibrations. Whether in a warehouse, at a festival, or in a late-night club, Moussa's performances are a unique experience, filled with experimental and fun turns that challenge and inspire.
