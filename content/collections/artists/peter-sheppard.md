        text: 'Peter Sheppard is a co-founder of the @process.pdx dance club, @holdmusicpdx, Acid Cult, and the Your Sunday Best day party series, and has a deep love for bringing humans together to rave. Born in Portland, Oregon, he probably won’t stop smiling or dancing until the day he dies. His fascination with music began as a child playing piano, influenced mostly by jazz and funk, which has continued as the driving force behind his productions and DJ sets. A dancer at heart, Peter is always searching for ways to laugh and create light-hearted connections with the people around him. Peter has been producing dance music for well over a decade, and only in the last year has begun to release his music on labels. Check out his most recent release “On My Way” on the Acid Camp label, as well as his previous release “Dada Entry” with Lauren Flax and Jason Burns on London/UK-based label, Moveltraxx.'
