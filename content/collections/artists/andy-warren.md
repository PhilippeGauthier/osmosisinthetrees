        text: 'A​ndy Warren is a DJ and an all-around record fanatic who has helped elevate the underground dance music scene in Portland, Oregon by sharing music and throwing consistent, quality events for over a decade. Through his party collective, ‘Believe You Me’ that he’s run alongside partner Robert Ginkgo, Warren has built a bridge for international artists touring the West Coast. His energy and reverence for the history and culture of DJing has not only helped make Portland a tour stop, but also ushered in blissful day parties and cozy afterhour gatherings, curated to exploring body music beyond its contemporary realms. To that end, Warren is a selector who is not afraid to take risks when he steps up into the booth, channeling layered emotions and varied rhythms with new and old flavors of house, techno, ambient, electro and eclectic music.'

        text: 'His energy, technical prowess, and penchant for strengthening community has lead him to play throughout the United States as well as Latin America & Europe. Andy Warren carries the spirit of the underground wherever he touches down, always bringing a multifarious selection of music for his late night (or early morning) musical journeys, exposing the mind and body to rhythms and rarities for heads and dancers alike. In the spring of 2024, a decade of efforts culminated with Andy & a team of like minded (crazy?) believers in the cause, opening a brick & mortar dance club - Process PDX. A rugged, yet cozy home for the Portland underground community.'
