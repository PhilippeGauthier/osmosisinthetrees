        text: 'Morph is a selector existing on the membrane of the drum that connects possible futures to ancient pasts. Shifting from club bangers to textural psychedelic left field explorations at any and all energy levels his sets are somatic celebrations of amphibious rhythm inspired by the Pacific Northwest biomes around his home base in Portland, Oregon. The stone at the center of dance music is the trance state, and Morph often invokes the trickster via risk taking tracks to re-engage your awareness in the service of this goal. Recent forays into the downtempo ecosystems have elicited an epigenetic shift marked by the appearance of a new iteration of productions and mixes. This amoebic behaviour may require a new species classification.'
