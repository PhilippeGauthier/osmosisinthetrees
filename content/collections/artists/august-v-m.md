        text: "Augustina Moore aka August V. M. is a trans singer-songwriter, music producer, sound designer & DJ born on Vashon Island, Washington, now living and working in Seattle. Bringing her hardware musings to Osmosis in the Trees this fall, August's sound world is at once the dewed resonances of her island upbringing, a glitched breath of cybernetic residue, and dubbed-out homage to ambient pop songwriting. Sound-as-space that feels meticulously sculpted, yet only discovered beneath some humming molecular periphery."
