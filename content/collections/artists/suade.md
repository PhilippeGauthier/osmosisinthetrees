        text: 'suade is a selector propelled by a shapeshifting sonic tapestry; she focuses on mood and storytelling over genre. Her approach is characterized by blends that deftly jump between rolling percussion, psychedelic textures, bassbin rattlers, and euphoric grooves—all united by an undercurrent of dancefloor sensibilities. Mixes include features on Truants, Darker than Wax, Daisychain, and more.'
