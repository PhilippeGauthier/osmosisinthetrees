        text: 'Robin Arthur Lohrey is a sonic ritualist, writer and dancer born and raised in the San Juan Islands of the Salish Sea, now living in a mountain valley of the Western Catskills of New York. His work is primarily concerned with personal mythmaking and collaborates with a cast of inner characters to channel his work.'

        text: 'One of these characters is named Ronan, meaning ‘a little seal’ in Gaelic. He is a shapeshifting selkie spirit connected to elven and druidic lineages whose sonic fingerprint is rooted in the mycorrhizal history of sound system music and watered by the deep wellsprings of Jazz improvisation, traditional Celtic folk music and post-modern electro acoustics. Through the arcane power of music and communal dance he seeks to remind himself and others of the great freedom, power and responsibility that is bestowed upon all humankind, so we may remember our place in a living universe and create more harmonic relations with ourselves, each other and our more than human kin.'
