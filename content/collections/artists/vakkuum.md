        text: "Vakkuum is the moniker of local alpinist Wyatt P. After a successful early career releasing music on Tiga's Turbo Recordings and touring around the globe, he took a step back from the club scene to achieve more balance in his life. Nowadays, Vakkuum can be found playing around The PNW or recreating to high alpine environments seeking new inspiration and rejuvenation for the music he grew up on and loves."
