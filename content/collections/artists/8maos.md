        text: 'Miles aka @8maos has been a constant in the Portland rave community since 2015, lighting up dance floors from in front of and behind the decks. He may have dipped out to drive his van around the continent for a few years but his heart never left. Living in a van for 3 years naturally compelled him to live a minimal lifestyle, which just reinforced and grew his love for minimal music. Getting wrecked by some of the best DJs on the planet on his travels certainly helped ;)'

        text: "And now he's back to bring the music he loves to the community he loves. Whether he's curating or DJing, 8maos gravitates towards music that pulls you in - deep, dark, groovy, textured, sensual. His joy of selecting tracks for each unique set and setting is what keeps him going and takes his mixing to the next level."
