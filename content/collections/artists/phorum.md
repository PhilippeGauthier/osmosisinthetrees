        text: "Phorum is a production and DJ moniker for Portland-based duo Gardenparty and wav4ms. Between them lies three decades' worth of sound engineering and DJing. Founder of Osmosis, wav4ms, and Osmosis resident Gardenparty, form a heavyweight alliance committed to fibrillating rhythms and anomalous sounds. Behind the decks, the two often push each other's selections into earworm-festered waters. Their love for the heady and abstract has catalyzed the party series “Contact”."
