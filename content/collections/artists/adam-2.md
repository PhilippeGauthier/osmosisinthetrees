        text: "For Adam 2, electronic music has always provided an opportunity for self-discovery, creative exploration, and personal liberation. Since 2016, the Vancouver-based producer and DJ have worn multiple hats in the city’s growing scene, fulfilling the roles of promoter, music curator, and co-founder of Techno label PPRZ.\_2020 saw the release of featured mixes on Honcho, Techno Hour of Power, and the creation of Afrofuturism is Now – a mix series amplifying the music of Black artists. As COVID-19 restrictions were lifted at the end of 2021, Adam 2 maintained their stride sharing the bill with Carlos Souffront, Shanti Celeste, and Objekt, along with launching their latest venture, PPRZ, a Vancouver-based label curated by queer, POC artists.\_As Adam 2’s career gains momentum, they continue to build their reputation by transfixing audiences with evocative, experimental techno that intersects dynamic physicality and playful cerebralism."
