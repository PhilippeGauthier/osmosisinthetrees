        text: '2lanes is a unifying sonic energy force breathing a vibrant perspective into life, love, and happiness through music. His artistic practice is one of mutualism, & creation - a constantly evolving process inspired equally by the time dilating studio wizardry of dub, the transcendent bliss of live performance, and the magic he experiences through his friends & day to day existence in the world.'

        text: 'Through releases on Ceramic Records, his own AUTO SHOP imprint, the modern classic “Baby’s Born to Fish” on Portage Garage Sounds, and his involvement in the Detroit-based party "Formula" 2lanes’s work is beloved by listeners & dancers worldwide - never confined to any one sound or style, instead interconnected through layers of spirited kineticism, surrealist world building, and a delightfully rebellious spirit pulsating through it’s core.'
