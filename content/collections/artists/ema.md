        text: "Operating as a conduit to the on-going mutations of low-end futurism, EMA’s selections warp rhythmic advances around a respected tradition in sub weight. Rigorously informed by the foundational lineage of dub-inspired club music, she encompasses not only the sounds but also the unity mentality of her influences. Her application of this ethos to mix crafting is sensational, pairing evocative wub narratives with a penchant for screw-face bass anthems. It's an undeniable gift, evident in EMA’s monthly residency on Rinse FM, celebrated mixes for Crack Magazine, Ransom Note and Melbourne Deepcast, notable appearances at Fabric London, Corsica Studios, Printworks, NYC’s Public Records and the Arcadia Stage at All Together Now festival, multiple broadcast for Boiler Room and The Lot Radio and the co-hosting Keep Hush’s inaugural Irish stream with Woozy."
