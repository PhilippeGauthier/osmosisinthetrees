        text: 'Tristan Arp is a producer and DJ born in suburban Detroit,specializing in slippery, outsider club music and polyrhythmic ambient compositions. While his leftfield bass records for 3024, SLINK and his own Human Pitch label are driven by a search for unheard rhythms, his full-length debut Sculpturegardening and forthcoming a pool, a portal (out October 25th) for the UK label Wisdom Teeth explore gentler biomorphic environments, merging cello with modular synthesis. Wild, multi-genre freakouts and unexpected blends dot the winding paths of his DJ sets, while his live sets weave hand-drumming with electronics and his sound installations offer generative multi-channel arrangements that never play the same way twice.'
