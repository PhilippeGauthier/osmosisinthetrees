        text: 'Emerging from the mossy depths of the Pacific Northwest, Gardenparty has nucleated themselves in the Portland rave scene as an Osmosis resident and a co-curator for the Process club series “Contact”. Known for their dark, bass-fueled, and texturally explorative sets, Gardenparty cherishes the weird. Whether it be dispersing dubstep-infused chuggers or deranged hypnotic rominimal, you can be certain they will be advocating for the abnormal. <3'
